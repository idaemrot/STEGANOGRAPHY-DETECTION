Steganography poses significant challenges to digital security, as it allows for the 
covert embedding of information within seemingly innocuous media files such as 
images, audio, text, and video. This report has presented a comprehensive analysis of 
steganography detection methods tailored to each type of digital file. 
 For image steganography detection, the utilization of Discrete Cosine Transform 
(DCT) and statistical analysis proved effective in identifying anomalies in 
frequency components, indicative of hidden data. 
 Audio steganography detection focused on analysing properties such as sample 
width, channels, and frame rate. Deviations from standard audio characteristics 
provided insights into potential covert communication. 
 In text steganography detection, content analysis played a crucial role in 
identifying abnormal patterns or lengths within text files, suggesting the 
presence of concealed information. 
 Video steganography detection employed temporal and spatial analysis 
techniques. Frame differencing and DCT-based anomaly detection across video 
frames enabled the identification of anomalies that could indicate hidden data.

By understanding and implementing these detection techniques, organizations and 
cybersecurity professionals can enhance their ability to detect and mitigate threats 
posed by steganographic techniques, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and 
maintaining trust in digital communications.
